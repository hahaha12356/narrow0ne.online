      <h1>Narrow One Beginner’s Complete Guide: From First Login to First Win</h1>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Look, I've been playing Narrow One since the early days, and I can tell you this game is
        deceptively simple but brutally rewarding. It's a browser-based multiplayer archery FPS—no downloads, runs
        smooth even on potato setups, perfect for quick sessions between classes or during lunch breaks. But don't let
        the accessibility fool you; the skill ceiling is high. This guide will get you from confused newbie to competent
        teammate faster than you'd figure it out solo.</p>

          <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">This is what you're getting into: fluid archery duels, tight
            sightlines, and coordinated team pushes that separate wins from losses.</figcaption>

      </div>

      <h2>Game Basics & Modes</h2>
      <p>Narrow One is all about fast-paced bow combat—no hitscan weapons, no spray-and-pray. Every shot is a projectile
        with travel time and arc, which means you need to lead moving targets and compensate for distance. The main
        modes are Team Deathmatch (TDM), Free For All (FFA), Capture the Flag (CTF), and Control Points. If you're just
        starting out, stick with TDM or CTF. You'll learn positioning, teamwork, and how to trade kills effectively. FFA
        is fun but chaotic—save it for when you've got the fundamentals down and want to sharpen your 1v1 skills.</p>

        <li>Shoot: Left Mouse • Aim: Right Mouse</li>
        <li>Jump: Space • Weapon Switch: 1–3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here's what I wish someone told me on day one: run full-screen mode, close every other tab (especially YouTube
        or Twitch), and dial in your mouse sensitivity early. Start medium and tweak it by 10% increments until flick
        shots feel natural. And seriously, get a headset. Audio cues—footsteps, bow releases, even the subtle whoosh of
        arrows flying past—give you a massive edge. Half the kills I get come from hearing someone before I see them.

      <h2>Three Goals for Your First Match</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Learn to draw and release with intent, not spam-clicking.</strong> New players love to spam arrows.
          Don't. Each shot should be deliberate—pre-draw behind cover, peek, release, hide. Rhythm beats volume every
          time.</li>
        <li><strong>Memorize one map's main lanes and one safe side route.</strong> You don't need to know the whole map
          yet. Pick one main lane (usually the center choke point) and one flanking route. Learn where enemies typically
          hold angles, and you'll stop walking into free deaths.</li>
        <li><strong>Join a teammate's push instead of lone wandering.</strong> This isn't a solo game. Stick with at
          least one teammate, especially in CTF. Two archers covering each other will dominate a lone wolf every single
          time. Trust me, I've been on both sides of that equation.</li>

      <h2>Basic Movement & Survival</h2>
      <p>Movement is half the battle. Practice short strafe patterns—left, right, left—mixed with sudden stops to throw
        off enemy timing. Jump-peeking is your best friend: jump into view, release mid-air, land behind cover. Never
        stand still in the open. Ever. Move from cover to cover, and when you re-peek, do it from a different angle.
        Predictable peeks get you killed. I learned that the hard way about a thousand times.</p>

      <h2>Beginner Aiming Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>Aiming in Narrow One isn't about crosshair placement like in CS:GO—it's about timing and trajectory prediction.
        Pre-draw your bow before you peek (hold right-click), then expose yourself for just 0.4–0.6 seconds, release,
        and get back to cover. For long-range shots, aim slightly above your target to compensate for arrow drop. And
        here's a pro tip: always fight from high ground when possible. It shortens the effective range, flattens your
        arrow arc, and makes you harder to hit. High ground wins duels.</p>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-4">
        <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded-xl shadow">
          <figure>

        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Communication & Awareness</h2>
      <p>Good comms win games. Use simple, clear callouts: "left lane," "bridge," "high ground," "two mid." Don't write
        essays in chat—just the essentials. And listen more than you talk. Audio cues are insanely valuable. You'll hear
        footsteps, bow releases, and arrow impacts before you see the enemy. I've clutched rounds purely because I heard
        someone reloading around a corner. Train your ears as much as your aim.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>Alright, you've got the basics. After a few matches, you'll start noticing patterns—where enemies like to camp,
        which routes are safer, when to push and when to hold. That's when you're ready for the advanced stuff. Check
        out our guides on mode-specific strategy and advanced archery mechanics. The learning curve is steep, but man,
        it's satisfying when everything clicks. See you on the battlefield.</p>
